#Spice Engine
A node-based image processor

##Feature Goals
- Portability: given that it has a UI for it, it should run on any of the five major operating systems
- Quality: output should equal or surpass the quality achievable with high-end editing software
- Speed: it should crunch through editing 150MP images in real time on an mid-range MacBook Pro or equivalent machines (i.e. maxed out 13" version, basic 15" version from two generations back)
- Generality: it should work with as simple or as complex a processing pipeline as the user wants
- Extensibility: new filters and transformations should be addable without much effort (and preferably using a well-known plugin API like OpenFX) and run at native speed
- Pluggability: it should be trivially extensible to be usable with any plugin interface (e.g. PS, OpenFX)
